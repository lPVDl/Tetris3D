# Task - Create classic 3D tetris.
Random tetromino shapes are falling from top into rect cup with width 10 and tall 20 cells. In fly player can rotate shape by 90Â° and can move it horizontally. Also can accelerate shape falling when decision is made. Shape is falling until obstacle is met. If horizontal rect is fulfilled with blocks, than it disappears and all blocks above move below. Additionally next shape is shown, which allows player to plan. Game haste is slowly increasing. Game is over when new shape can not fit into cup. Player receives scores for each fulfilled rect, so the task is to complete rows without gapes as long as possible.

# Controls
WASD - move blocks\
RMB - camera rotation (hold + move)\
LMB - block rotation (press + swipe + release)\
SPACE - increase block falling speed
